TODO
- dispose properly of everything before updating representations.
currently, animation methods keep piling on, and dimensions aren't updated.

- create a group of objects:
	- profiles (2)
	- surface
	- 2x4s (2 for the front, and one every x units under the surface)

- stop passing scale around, it should not exist.
