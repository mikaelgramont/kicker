TODO
- move the geometry/object creation, update and eventual animations into representation objects, those should not be in renderers.

- create a group of objects:
	- profiles (2)
	- surface (itself a group broken down into n slats of fixed width)
	- 2x4s (2 for the front, and one every x units under the surface)
