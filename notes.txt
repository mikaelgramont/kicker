TODO
- solve the sponginess/going through ground. Maybe by lifting the kicker a bit?
- create a helper that builds a box body given a THREE.Object3D.
- when dropping the kicker in place, create a cloud of smoke with particles.
- build an SVG renderer and representation with lengths displayed.
- apply grass around. http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.grass
