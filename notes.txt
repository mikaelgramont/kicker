TODO
- dispose properly of everything before updating representations.
currently, animation methods keep piling on, and dimensions aren't updated.

- create a group of objects:
	- profiles (2)
	- surface (itself a group broken down into n slats of fixed width)
	- 2x4s (2 for the front, and one every x units under the surface)
