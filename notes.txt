TODO
- look into oimo.js http://lo-th.github.io/Oimo.js/index.html
- cleanup before recreating kicker, memory leaks are probably pretty bad right now.
- think about how to add more kickers to the scene. that probably requires a refactoring of the object compositions. This would mean a different app altogether though.
	app 	-> 	kicker 	->	kickermodel
						->	representation -> renderer

	app 	->	physics (world)
			->	scene (three)
			->	objects	-> [(mesh, body)]

- create a helper that shows where lights are.
- create a little inspector to pick objects out of a list and move/rotate them around.
- when dropping the kicker in place, create a cloud of smoke with particles.
- build an SVG renderer and representation with lengths displayed.
- apply grass around. http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/#threex.grass
